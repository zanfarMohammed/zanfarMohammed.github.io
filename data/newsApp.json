            "content": "Exercise can delay the development of osteoarthritis (OA), one of the most common causes of knee pain. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the Arthritis Foundation (AF)Trusted Source urge people to exercise to manage OA of the knee. Walking, cycling, swimming, tai chi, and yoga may all be beneficial. Being physically active boosts the health of cartilage tissue, whether a person has OA or not. Exercise also strengthens the way the body supports the joints. Strengthening the leg muscles is especially beneficial for the knees. People with joint pain can benefit from activities such as water aerobics, as this puts little strain on the knees."

            "content": "Individuals can work with a physical therapist to identify the best exercises and programs for their needs. Strengthening the upper leg muscles—the quadriceps muscles—through exercise can help to protect the knee joint. These muscles are at the sides and front of the thighs. Here are some ways to strengthen these muscles: Straighten and raise a leg while lying or sitting down. Place one foot up on a step, then the other, stepping down again, and repeating the step-ups. Sit on a chair and then stand and sit repeatedly for a minute. Do this in a slow, controlled way and avoid using the hands to support you. Hold a chair and squat until the kneecaps cover the toes. Do this 10 times.",

            "content": "Measures that can help to minimize knee strain include: avoiding low chairs and couches that you “sink” into. sitting on a pillow to raise your seating level, if necessary. checking that you have a good sitting posture, without slouching or leaning. wearing supportive shoes and avoiding those with broken arches, as they can result in abnormal force and wear on the knee. avoiding prolonged sitting and long periods without moving, as joints may become stiff and painful without movement"

Losing it helps to reduce long-term knee pain, including pain caused by arthritis. Extra weight on your body increases inflammation throughout the body and the knees are affected. Eating well helps with keeping weight off. A healthful diet means a balanced one that is: high in fruit, vegetables, and fiber - low in meat, animal fat, and other fat. The Arthritis Foundation recommend a Mediterranean-style diet that is rich in fresh produce. ExpertsTrusted Source urge people with OA of the knee to lose weight if they have overweight or obesity. A doctor or dietitian can help decide how much weight a person needs to lose. They can also help plan a suitable diet."
