            "content": "Exercise can delay the development of osteoarthritis (OA), one of the most common causes of knee pain. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the Arthritis Foundation (AF)Trusted Source urge people to exercise to manage OA of the knee. Walking, cycling, swimming, tai chi, and yoga may all be beneficial. Being physically active boosts the health of cartilage tissue, whether a person has OA or not. Exercise also strengthens the way the body supports the joints. Strengthening the leg muscles is especially beneficial for the knees. People with joint pain can benefit from activities such as water aerobics, as this puts little strain on the knees."

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the Arthritis Foundation (AF)Trusted Source urge people to exercise to manage OA of the knee. Walking, cycling, swimming, tai chi, and yoga may all be beneficial. Being physically active boosts the health of cartilage tissue, whether a person has OA or not. Exercise also strengthens the way the body supports the joints. Strengthening the leg muscles is especially beneficial for the knees. People with joint pain can benefit from activities such as water aerobics, as this puts little strain on the knees."
